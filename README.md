# IDTNet: Brain Tumor Classification Using Hybrid CNN Architecture

A novel deep learning approach for classifying brain tumors in MRI scans using IDTNet, a hybrid convolutional neural network that combines Inception modules, DenseNet connectivity, and transition layers with skip connections.

## üéØ Overview

This project introduces IDTNet (Inception-Dense-Transition Network), a custom CNN architecture designed specifically for brain tumor classification from MRI images. The model achieves 98.17% accuracy in classifying four types of brain conditions: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary tumors, and No Tumor cases.

### Key Features

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines strengths of Inception modules, DenseNet connectivity, and transition layers
- **High Performance**: Achieves 98.17% accuracy with 100% recall on meningioma class
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Trained on 7,023 MRI images from multiple sources (Figshare, SARTAJ, Br35H)
- **Robust Preprocessing**: Includes aggressive data augmentation and normalization techniques
- **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmarked against VGG16, DenseNet121, and InceptionV1 architectures

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **Image Resizing**: 512√ó512√ó3 ‚Üí 128√ó128√ó3 pixels
2. **Data Shuffling**: Prevents concentration on dataset subsets
3. **Train/Validation Split**: 80%/20% distribution
4. **Data Augmentation**:
    - Random rotation (¬±10 degrees)
    - Width/height shifts (10% range)
    - Shear transformation (10% range)
    - Zoom (10% range)
    - Horizontal flipping
    - Nearest-neighbor filling
